Just returned from EUSIPCO2025 in Sicily, with a few general reflections on conferences in general.

Conferences are worth attending, especially when you go in prepared. At BdSound we tend to read papers in advance, identify sessions with a high concentration of relevant work, and prioritize poster sessions—they’re simply better for real conversations. You can ask questions, get into the details, and often reconnect with authors later.

Presenting your own paper makes things easier: people come to you. Otherwise, it’s on you to initiate. That’s part of the experience. Our paper on siren detection gathered some interest, especially due to its very low computational requirements.

And while the technical content is central, the setting matters too. A good venue, local culture, and a schedule that leaves room for informal exchanges—those things contribute more than they’re often given credit for. Not every workspace comes with a sea breeze.
