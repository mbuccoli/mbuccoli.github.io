I was in Florence to present the paper "Effects of Automotive Microphone Frequency Response Characteristics and Noise Conditions on Speech and ASR Quality – An Experimental Evaluation" at the AES Italy Annual Meeting.

Conferences are valuable for three reasons: gaining inspiration from fellow researchers, building a community around scientific topics, and having the opportunity to visit remarkable places. The Italian meeting delivered on all three fronts.

I attended many interesting presentations, including some rather unusual ones —such as a study on capturing chewing sounds to evaluate food crispiness— and met several brilliant Italian scientists, including some of my former students who are now pursuing successful careers in audio analysis and processing.

The Sala del Buonumore ("Hall of Jolliness") was likely one of the most beautiful venues where I have ever presented a paper. I also took some time to visit the usual sights around Florence.

I look forward to the next AES Italia meeting and hope to connect with more Italian audio scientists at upcoming AES conventions, starting with AES Automotive Audio in Summer 2026.

Special thanks to my co-author, Simone Shawn Cazzaniga, who served as an excellent ambassador for BdSound ’s innovation team.
