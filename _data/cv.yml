        highlights:
        - dance motion capture analysis
        - alignment of dance motion capture and video signals
        - design and development of annotation tools for dance sequences
      - name: Intermusic 
        summary: > 
          the INTERMUSIC project aimed to create a high-quality online environment for remote music education, specializing 
          in low-latency technology for real-time rehearsals and performances. It was coordinated by the Conservatorio di 
          Musica "Giuseppe Verdi" di Milano in partnership with Politecnico di Milano, the Royal Danish Academy of Music, 
          and the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre. The ultimate goal was to integrate blended learning into European
           higher education to foster international collaboration while reducing travel costs and environmental impact.
        highlights:
        - dance motion capture analysis
        - alignment of dance motion capture and video signals
