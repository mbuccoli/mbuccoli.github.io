Since 2019, I have served as a Senior Innovation Scientist at BdSound, where I spearhead the development of advanced speech-based solutions using machine and deep learning. In this role, I co-lead the innovation group, scout emerging technologies, and provide technical management for both internal and external projects. I am also dedicated to academic mentorship, co-supervising M.Sc. students.

My academic foundation includes a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (Università di Pisa) and an M.Sc. in Sound and Music Engineering (Politecnico di Milano). I earned my Ph.D. in 2016, focusing on the intersection of signal processing and semantic representations for Music Information Retrieval (MIR), followed by two years of postdoctoral research.
