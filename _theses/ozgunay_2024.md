This work tackles key challenges in Speaker Verification (SV) by introducing a novel, lightweight SV system designed for real-time applications in noisy and reverberant environments.  The system leverages advanced convolutional techniques within a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and real-time pooling layers to enhance responsiveness and stability across various acoustic conditions.  While it may not achieve the highest performance levels, it excels in real-time processing, making it ideal for dynamic environments where speed and computational efficiency are crucial.
