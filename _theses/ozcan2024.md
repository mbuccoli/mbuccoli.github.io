Input gain variations can significantly impact the performance of DNN-based real-time speech processing systems. 

This thesis explores three methods to enhance robustness against these variations: Gain-Augmented Training, Differential Features, and Smoothed Frame Normalization. 

Experimental results show that these approaches improve the consistency and reliability of DNN outputs under varying input gain condition.
