We propose a cascaded network with a lightweight phase-unaware approach and an optional more computationally demanding phase-aware stage to perform single-channel Speech Enahncement based on Deep Learning (DL). Our solution performs as good as more complex baselines in terms of parameters and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) according to both objective quality metrics and subjective evaluations
