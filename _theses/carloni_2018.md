similarity modeling that relies on both content-based and user-related similarity information. We exploit a non-metric scaling technique to first elaborate a low-dimensional space (or embedding) which fulfills the similarity information provided by the user, and a regression technique to learn a mapping between content-based information and embedding-related information.
