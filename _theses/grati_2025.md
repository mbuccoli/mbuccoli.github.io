This work proposes a data-driven and spectrum-based BWE method that leverages the source-filter representation of speech. The model predicts an amplitude mask applied to a shaped noise signal. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves competitive perceptual quality, while drastically reducing computational complexity.
